# Financial Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis Dashboard

This project is a synthetic **multi-scenario stress testing and forecasting dashboard** built in Python and Streamlit.

It demonstrates how to:
- Generate synthetic multi-year financial data for several support functions (technology, real estate, finance, HR, legal).
- Project **Base Case, Moderate Stress, and Severe Stress** scenarios over a configurable multi-quarter horizon.
- Calculate key **risk and performance metrics** such as capital ratio, efficiency ratio, cumulative stressed losses, and Risk Appetite breaches.
- Produce **visual dashboards** and autogenerated **PowerPoint / PDF summaries** for management-style reporting.
